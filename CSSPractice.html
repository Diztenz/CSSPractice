<p>Change the Color of Text<br>
Now let's change the color of some of our text.<br>
<br>
We can do this by changing the style of your h2 element.<br>
<br>
The property that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the <br>color style property.<br>
<br>
Here's how you would set your h2 element's text color to blue:<br>
<br>
&lt;h2 style="color: blue;">CatPhotoApp&lt;/h2><br>
&lt;h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp&lt;/h2>
Note that it is a good practice to end inline style declarations with a ; .<br>
</p>


<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <p>Use CSS Selectors to Style ElementsPassed
With CSS, there are hundreds of CSS properties that you can use to change the way an element looks on your page.<br>
<br>
When you entered &lt;h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp&lt;/h2>, you were styling that individual h2 element with inline CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets.<br>
<br>
That's one way to specify the style of an element, but there's a better way to apply CSS.<br>
<br>
At the top of your code, create a style block like this:<br>
<br>
&lt;style><br>
&lt;/style><br>
Inside that style block, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements. For example, if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, you would add a style rule that looks like this:<br>
<br>
&lt;style><br>
  h2 {<br>
    color: red;<br>
  }<br>
&lt;/style><br>
<br>
Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces ({ and }) around each element's style rule(s). You also need to make sure that your element's style definition is between the opening and closing style tags. Finally, be sure to add a semicolon to the end of each of your element's style rules.<br>
<br>
</p>

<style>
  h2 {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

<p>Use a CSS Class to Style an ElementPassed<br>
Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.<br>
<br>
Here's an example CSS class declaration:<br>
<br>
&lt;style><br>
  .blue-text {<br>
    color: blue;<br>
  }<br>
&lt;/style><br>
You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the &lt;style> tag. You can apply a class to an HTML element like this: &lt;h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp&lt;/h2>. Note that in your CSS style element, class names start with a period"." In your HTML elements' class attribute, the class name does not include the period.</p>
<br>

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

<p>Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class<br>
Classes allow you to use the same CSS styles on multiple HTML elements.<br> You can see this by applying your red-text class to the first p element.<br>

&lt;style><br>
  .red-text {<br>
    color: red;<br>
  }<br>
&lt;/style><br>
<br>
&lt;h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp&lt;/h2><br>
<br>
  &lt;p class="red-text">Click here to view more &lt;a href="#">cat photos&lt;/a>.&lt;/p><br>
</p>

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <p>Change the Font Size of an Element<br>
Font size is controlled by the font-size CSS property, like this:<br>
<br>
h1 {<br>
  font-size: 30px;<br>
}<br>
</p>

<p>Set the Font Family of an Element<br>
You can set which font an element should use, by using the font-family property.<br>
<br>
For example, if you wanted to set your h2 element's font to sans-serif, you would use the following CSS:<br>

h2 {<br>
  font-family: sans-serif; <br><!-- other example font monospace -->
}<br>
<br>
  p {<br>
    font-size: 16px;<br>
    font-family: monospace;<br>
  }<br>
</p>

<p>Import a Google Font<br>
In addition to specifying common fonts that are found on most operating systems, <br>
we can also specify non-standard, custom web fonts for use on our website. <br>
There are many sources for web fonts on the Internet. For this example we will <br>
focus on the Google Fonts library.<br>
<br>
Google Fonts is a free library of web fonts that you can use in your CSS by <br>
referencing the font's URL.<br>
<br>
So, let's go ahead and import and apply a Google font <br>
(note that if Google is blocked in your country, you will need to skip this challenge).<br>
<br>
To import a Google Font, you can copy the font's URL from the Google Fonts <br>
library and then paste it in your HTML. For this challenge, we'll import the <br>
Lobster font. To do this, copy the following code snippet and paste it into the <br>
top of your code editor (before the opening style element):<br>
<br>
&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><br>
Now you can use the Lobster font in your CSS by using Lobster as the FAMILY_NAME as in the following <br>example:<br>
<br>
font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;<br>
The GENERIC_NAME is optional, and is a fallback font in case the other specified font is not available.<br> This is covered in the next challenge.<br>
<br>
Family names are case-sensitive and need to be wrapped in quotes if there is a space in the name. For<br> example, you need quotes to use the "Open Sans" font, but not to use the Lobster font.<br>
	<br>
</p>

<!-- <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> -->


<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster;
  }
  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: serif;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
  <div>
    <p>Things cats love:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>cat nip</li>
      <li>laser pointers</li>
      <li>lasagna</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>

      <li>other cats</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked> Indoor</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" checked> Loving</label>

    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label><br>
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>

    <p>
    	Specify How Fonts Should Degrade<br>
There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers. These generic font families include<br> monospace, serif and sans-serif<br>
<br>
When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another font.<br>
<br>
For example, if you wanted an element to use the Helvetica font, but degrade to the sans-serif font when<br> Helvetica isn't available, you will specify it as follows:<br>
<br>
p {<br>
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;<br>
}<br>
<br>
Generic font family names are not case-sensitive. Also, they do not need quotes because they are CSS <br>keywords.<br>
    </p>
<p>
	Size Your Images<br>
CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use px<br>
(pixels) to specify the image's width.<br>
<br>
For example, if we wanted to create a CSS class called larger-image that gave HTML elements <br>
a width of 500 pixels, we'd use:<br>
<br>
&lt;style><br>
  .smaller-image {<br>
    width: 500px;<br>
  }<br>
&lt;/style><br>
Makes the image smaller when the img is given the .smaller-image (.larger-image) class. <br>
 &lt;a href="#">&lt;img class="smaller-image" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">&lt;/a>
